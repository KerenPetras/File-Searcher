<h2> File Searcher Program </h2>

<h4> In the middle of our .net studies, we had to make a file searcher program as a concole application. </br>
For this program I had to use C# code and create a database table using SQL. </br>
</br>
As you run the program you are asked to type the name of the file that you are searching for, </br>
and when the program finishes to search for the specific file you recived the location of the file. </br>
</br>
When the user are searching couple of times, all the data is saves together with the history searches. </br>
